# üö® Shoplifting Detection Web App

This project is an advanced **real-time shoplifting detection system** that uses a custom 3D ConvNet and **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) for precise detection. It is designed to detect theft in retail environments with high accuracy and dynamic real-time video analysis. The system integrates **optical flow tracking**, **sliding window detection**, and **dynamic bounding boxes** for accurate suspect tracking. The user interface is built with **Django** to provide a seamless and interactive web experience for security teams.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YoussifShaabanQzamel/Shoplifting-Detection-Web-App.git
cd Shoplifting-Detection-Web-App
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### 4. Run the Django app
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## üåê Web App Functionality

- **Upload video**: Security personnel upload video footage for shoplifting detection.
- **Real-time detection**: The backend processes the video, detecting shoplifting events in real-time.
- **Review results**: Interactive UI displays frames with bounding boxes around detected individuals.
- **Download results**: Export video frames with overlayed detection results.

## üìå Notes

- The system uses **YOLO** for fast and accurate object detection and a custom **3D ConvNet** for deeper feature extraction.
- The web app was designed using **Django** for a dynamic and responsive interface.
- Ensure that video files are in the correct format and resolution for optimal detection performance.
